# License and Academic Integrity Notice

I encouage usage and adaptations of this Homework Project by anyone. I
encourge students of me to build a data science portfolio. This Homework
Projekt can be part of it.

The intention of this license is to

1.  ensure that students do not accidentially or purposeful hide away
    that a large part of the work is guided by the instructions. Even
    when the instructions are open, the work you did can show mastery of
    skills.
2.  help students to be transparent about what their own original work
    is.
3.  alert future students to not blindly copy from public work of others
    to ensure learning and avoid breaching academic integrity policies.

When you worked through this project, you can keep it in its finished
form as a public repository in your portfolio or publish the HTML from
the repository, when you keep the *License and Academic Integrity* part
in the README and the INSTRUCTIONS in the repository.

### Original Work Declaration

You can replace the content of the section *Information* above by a
statement like:

*I, \[Your Name\], worked through this project using the
[INSTRUCTIONS](INSTRUCTIONS.md) in my own way. \[OPTIONAL: Beyond that I
did original work: \[…\]\]*

### Usage Terms for future students with a similar Homework Project

This code is made available for educational reference only. Students
currently enrolled in similar courses having this as a Homework project
must respect:

- Do NOT copy code blindly for their own homework. Follow your
  instructions and do it yourself.
- There is nothing wrong reading this.
- Be aware that this project may differ from current assignments, and
  blindly copying code not fitting to your instructions can serve as
  evidence for plagiarism.
- Follow your institution’s **academic integrity policy**!

### For teachers

Feel free to use this project in your own teaching. If you modify it,
please change the first line somehow like:

*This repository is a Data Science Homework Project made by \[YOUR
NAME\] based on \[LINK TO THIS REPOSITORY\].*

The main purpose is that it does not look that I am responsible for your
version.

I am happy to hear about your usage and modifications if you like to
notify me.
